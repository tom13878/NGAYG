# Introduction




# Background


# Methodology

We use a stochastic frontier production function [@Aigner1977; @Meeusen1977] to estimate the technical efficiency yield gap. The model is specified as follows for our study:


\begin{equation}
\label{sfa}
y_i=x_i\beta+v_i-u_i
\end{equation}

where, $y_i$ is the logarithm of actual yield (ya) for maize plot $i$, $x_i$ is a vector containing growth defining, growth limiting and growth reducing factors a set of control variables, $\beta$ is a vector of parameters, $v_i$  is a symmetric random error and $u_i$ is non-negative random variable with a half normal distribution that measures technical inefficiency. The error terms $v_i$  and $u_i$ will be influenced by unobserved household and plot-specific effects, such as farmersâ€™ management skills and soil quality, which are correlated with some of the explanatory variables, such as for example fertilizer application. Simply pooling the data for the two survey years will result in coefficients that are biased (Hausman and Taylor, 1981).

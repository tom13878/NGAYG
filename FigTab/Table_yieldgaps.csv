yield gap,Calculation,Definition,Measures,Proximate cause,Absolute cause,
Total yield gap (Yg),Yp - Ya,The difference between (water-limited) potential yield and actual yield,The biophysical potential for farmers to increase actual yield in a specific agroeconomic environment,All below,,
Technical efficiency yield gap (Yte),Yte - Ya,The difference between technical efficiency yield and actual yield measured as the distance to the frontier yield response function,"The potential for farmers to increase actual yield, using the same inputs and under the same agroecological conditions in comparison to best-practice. ","Suboptimal crop management (e.g.  differences in establishment dates, and time, space and form of the inputs applied) that are related to a combination of 'knowlegde' factors including differences in experience, practice, management skills and access to extension services.","A variety of 'knowlegde' factors, including differences in experience, practice and management skills and access to extension services.",
Economic yield gap (Ye),Ye - Yte,The difference between economic yield and technical efficiency yield,The extent to which (technically efficient) farmers allocate their resources in an economically efficient (profit maximizing).,"Objectives of the farmer: profit maximizing, environmental or maximum production","Market conditions, in particular transaction costs, missing credit and insurance markets and and information asymmetries on production decisions of the farmer. ",
Feasible yield gap (Yf),Yf - Ye,The difference between feasible yield and economic yield,The technical potential for farmers to increase actual yield given best-available technology.,"Objectives of the farmer: profit maximizing, environmental or maximum production",,"Although farmers can technically close this gap by applying more inputs, economic constraints will prevent them from doing so. This gap is also expected to be relatively large in developing countries, where input prices are relatively high because of market poor dealer networks, high transportation costs and small market size"
Technology yield gap (Yt),Yp - Yf,The distance between the frontier and theoretical yield response curve measured by the difference between (water-limited) potential yield and feasible yield,"Instead, the main explanation has to be sought in (the lack of) access to and availability of appropriate technologies (Tittonell & Giller 2013).",,,
Resource yield gap (Y,Yf - yte,The Difference between feasible yield and technical efficiency yield,The extent to which farmers have an objective different from yield maximization. ,Combined impact of Economic yield and and feasible yield gap causes,,

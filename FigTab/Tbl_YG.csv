Yield gap,Estimation,Definition,Measures,Causes
Total yield gap (Yg),Yp - Ya,The gap between (water-limited) potential yield and actual yield,The biophysical potential for farmers to increase actual yield in a specific agroeconomic environment,The combination of all causes below
Technical efficiency yield gap (TEYg),Yte - Ya,The gap between technical efficiency yield and actual yield measured as the distance to the frontier yield response function,The potential for farmers to increase actual yield in comparison with best-practice farmers that  use the same level of inputs and operate under the same agroecological conditions.,"Suboptimal crop management caused by knowlegde constraints (e.g. differences in experience, practice, management skills and access to extension services)"
Economic yield gap (EYg),Ye - Yte,The gap between economic yield and technical efficiency yield,"The extent to which farmers can improve allocative efficiency and increase profits, given input and output prices and available technology. ",Market failures caused by missing credit and insurance markets and information assymetries on input and output prices. Production objectives other than profit maximization.
Feasible yield gap (FYg),Yf - Ye,The gap between feasible yield and economic yield,The extent to which economic constraints prevent farmers from producing maximum feasible yield  with the available technology and best-practice management,"Unfavourbale balance between input and output prices farm-gate (including transport costs, taxes, subsidies and other costs associated with the purchase of inputs and sale of outputs). "
Technology yield gap (TYg),Yp - Yf,The distance between the frontier and theoretical yield response curve measured by the gap between (water-limited) potential yield and feasible yield,The extent to which the lack of advanced technologies prevent (best-practice) farmers from reaching potential yield.,"Various national-level institutional, technological, economic and social factors that prevent the diffusion and adoption of advanced and appropriate technologies to farmers. "
Resource yield gap (RYg),Yf - yte,The gap between feasible yield and technical efficiency yield,The extent to which allocative efficiency and economic constraints prevent farmers from producing at maximum feasible yield with the available technology and best-practice management ,"Market failures, production objectives otherr than profit maximization,  and economic constraints.

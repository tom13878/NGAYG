abstract = {This paper applies a number of stochastic cost frontier models to a panel data set and compares their ability to distinguish unobserved heterogeneity from inefficiency variation among firms. The main focus is on Greene's 2005 panel data model that incorporates firm-specific effects in a stochastic frontier framework. In cases where the unobserved heterogeneity is corre- lated with explanatory variables, while the random effects estimators can be biased the fixed effects model may overestimate inefficiency. In line with Mundlak, a simple method is proposed to include such correlations in random effects specification. The sample includes 36 Swiss nursing homes operating from 1993 to 2001. The results suggest that the proposed specification can avoid the inconsistency problem while keeping the inefficiency estimates unaffected.},

abstract = {Favorable climate and soils for rainfed crop production, together with a relatively low population density, results in 70–90{\%} of Argentina grain production being exported. No assessment to date has tried to estimate the potential for extra grain production for soybean, wheat and maize, which account for 78{\%} of total harvested area, by yield gap closure on existing cropland area and its impact at a global scale. The objectives of this paper are (i) to estimate how much additional grain could be produced without expanding crop area by closing yield gaps in Argentina, (ii) to investigate how this production and yield gaps varies across regions and years, and (iii) to analyze how these inter-annual variations are related to El Ni{\~{n}}o—Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO). Production increase on existing crop area was assessed for soybean, wheat and maize by quantifying the yield gap (Yg), that is, the difference between water-limited yield potential (Yw) and actual yield (Ya). A bottom-up approach was followed to estimate Yw and Yg, in which these parameters were first estimated for specific locations in major crop producing areas and subsequently up-scaled to country level based on spatial distribution of crop area and climate zones. Locally-calibrated crop simulation models were used to estimate Yw at each selected location based on long-term weather data and dominant soil types and management practices. For the analyzed period, the national level Yg represented 41{\%} of Yw for both wheat and maize and 32{\%} of the Yw for soybean. If farmers had closed Yg from these levels to 20{\%} of Yw, Argentina could have increased soybean, wheat and maize production by a respective 7.4, 5.2, and 9.2Mt, without expanding cropland area. This additional production would have represented an increase of 9{\%}, 4{\%}, and 9{\%} of soybean, wheat, and maize global exports. This potential grain surplus was, however, highly variable because of the ENSO phenomenon: attainable soybean production was 12Mt higher in favorable “El Ni{\~{n}}o” years compared with unfavorable “La Ni{\~{n}}a” years. Interestingly, Yg tended to be higher in wet years, suggesting that farmers do not take full advantage of years with favorable conditions for rainfed crop production. Regional variation in Yg was found in Argentina highlighting the usefulness of this work as a framework to target research and, ultimately, reduce gaps in areas where current yields are well below their potential.},

abstract = {We computed three estimators of attainable yield for each of between 5 and 8 rainfed sunflower-growing regions of Argentina using between 5 and 9 years of data over the 2000-2007 interval. The estimators were based on comparative yield trial (CYT) data for commercial hybrids, on individual commercial field (ICF) data, and on reporting district (RD) yield information. Contrasts between these estimators led us to prefer the attainable (CYT) yield estimator over the other two. Attainable (CYT) yields ranged from 2.21 to 2.83tha-1 across regions. Yield gaps between mean farmer (RD data) and attainable (CYT) yields were computed using best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) values for both variables obtained using mixed linear models. These gaps were statistically significant (p???0.05) for all 8 regions and ranged from 0.37 to 1.18tha-1 across regions, for a country average of 0.75tha-1, equivalent to 41{\%} of the mean country yield of 1.85tha-1. We also used CYT data to examine the issue of recurrent, albeit infrequent, reports of unusually high yields. Mean yields for the top decile of comparative yield trial data ranged from 3.2 to 4.2tha-1 across regions, and the highest yields for this decile in any of the years of record ranged from 3.9 to 4.8tha-1 across regions. Individual commercial field yields were available for 5 regions. Gaps between BLUEs for this variable and attainable (CYT) yields were smaller than those between reporting district and attainable (CYT) yields, but were nevertheless significant in all 5 regions. A notable feature of reporting district, individual field, and yield trial data was their variability. At reporting district level within regions, contributions of spatial and temporal variability were roughly similar. The mean relative contribution of the trial effect to non-error variance of the CYT data exceeded 85{\%} across regions, dominating the contributions of genotype and of genotype by trial effects. We conclude that the magnitude of mean farmer/attainable (CYT) yield gaps for this crop in Argentina justifies further research aimed at reducing regional gaps; and that CYT data can be used to generate an appropriate benchmark for attainable yields. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Rice production must increase to meet future food requirements amid strong competition for limited resources. Yield gap analysis is a useful method to examine how large the ranges are between potential, desirable rice yields and those actually realized in farmers' fields. We analyzed farmers' yields in wet and dry seasons in four intensively cropped rice areas in Southeast Asia and explored opportunities for reducing the yield gap to meet future food requirements. We found yield gaps of 2.0-5.0tha-1 between average and climatic yield potential and 1.2-2.6tha-1 between average and best farmers' yields. In relative terms, average yields varied between 43{\%} and 75{\%} of the climatic yield potential and 61{\%} and 83{\%} of the best farmers' yields. Farmers with best yields were generally more educated, and used fertilizers and labor more efficiently than average farmers. The yield gaps between average and best farmers' yields are higher in rice-importing countries (Indonesia and Philippines) compared with rice-exporting countries (Thailand and Vietnam). Assuming no change in diet, closing the existing yield gap between average and best-yielding farmers can sufficiently cover the yield increase needed for 2050 in the three countries, except for the Philippines, where yield increase must be even higher. Trend analysis of yield increases of a population of farmers in Central Luzon (Philippines), which included a learning curve analysis, well described the process of technology adoption from 1966 to 2008, leading to higher yields. Using this analysis, for the Philippines, we predicted yields to increase (from 2007/2008 to 2050) by only 18{\%} with current cultivars, production technologies, and prevailing conditions. Therefore, structural changes are needed to boost farmers' yields to close the yield gap faster. Investments in technology transfer and institutional arrangements are suggested. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Silva2016,
abstract = {Explaining yield gaps is crucial to understand the main technical constraints faced by farmers to increase land productivity. The objective of this study is to decompose the yield gap into efficiency, resource and technology yield gaps for irrigated lowland rice-based farming systems in Central Luzon, Philippines, and to explain those yield gaps using data related to crop management, biophysical constraints and available technologies. Stochastic frontier analysis was used to quantify and explain the efficiency and resource yield gaps and a crop growth model (ORYZA v3) was used to compute the technology yield gap. We combined these two methodologies into a theoretical framework to explain rice yield gaps in farmers' fields included in the Central Luzon Loop Survey, an unbalanced panel dataset of about 100 households, collected every four to five years during the period 1966–2012. The mean yield gap estimated for the period 1979–2012 was 3.2tonha−1 in the wet season (WS) and 4.8tonha−1 in the dry season (DS). An average efficiency yield gap of 1.3tonha−1 was estimated and partly explained by untimely application of mineral fertilizers and biotic control factors. The mean resource yield gap was small in both seasons but somewhat larger in the DS (1.3tonha−1) than in the WS (1.0tonha−1). This can be partly explained by the greater N, P and K use in the highest yielding fields than in lowest yielding fields which was observed in the DS but not in the WS. The technology yield gap was on average less than 1.0tonha−1 during the WS prior to 2003 and ca. 1.6tonha−1 from 2003 to 2012 while in the DS it has been consistently large with a mean of 2.2tonha−1. Varietal shift and sub-optimal application of inputs (e.g. quantity of irrigation water and N) are the most plausible explanations for this yield gap during the WS and DS, respectively. We conclude that the technology yield gap explains nearly half of the difference between potential and actual yields while the efficiency and resource yield gaps explain each a quarter of that difference in the DS. As for the WS, particular attention should be given to the efficiency yield gap which, although decreasing with time, still accounted for nearly 40{\%} of the overall yield gap.},

To the extent that agricultural production is characterised by heterogeneous production conditions, estimation techniques that do not account for unobserved heterogeneity produce biased efficiency estimates. We therefore estimate a number of conventional panel data models and Greene's recently proposed ‘true' random-effects model, as well as an extension of the model to ascertain the effects of different specification on the production function and efficiency estimates. Our results appear to support theoretical expectations and previous findings according to which a specification that is both time-variant and also controls correlations between unobserved heterogeneity and the explanatory variables avoids heterogeneity bias and thus ensures consistent efficiency estimates.},

abstract = {In this study we estimate yield gaps for mixed crop-livestock smallholder farmers in seven Sub-Saharan African sites covering six countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Senegal and Burkina Faso). We also assess their potential to increase food production and reduce the GHG emission intensity of their products, as a result of closing these yield gaps. We use stochastic frontier analysis to construct separate production frontiers for each site, based on 2012 survey data prepared by the International Livestock Research Institute for the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security program. Instead of relying on theoretically optimal yields-a common approach in yield gap assessments-our yield gaps are based on observed differences in technical efficiency among farms within each site. Sizeable yield gaps were estimated to be present in all of the sites. Expressed as potential percentage increases in outputs, the average site-based yield gaps ranged from 28 to 167{\%} for livestock products and from 16 to 209{\%} for crop products. The emission intensities of both livestock and crop products registered substantial falls as a consequence of closing yield gaps. The relationships between farm attributes and technical efficiency were also assessed to help inform policy makers about where best to target capacity building efforts. We found a strong and statistically significant relationship between market participation and performance across most sites. We also identified an efficiency dividend associated with the closer integration of crop and livestock enterprises. Overall, this study reveals that there are large yield gaps and that substantial benefits for food production and environmental performance are possible through closing these gaps, without the need for new technology.},

abstract = {Yields of crops must increase substantially over the coming decades to keep pace with global food demand driven by population and income growth. Ultimately global food production capacity will be limited by the amount of land and water resources available and suitable for crop production, and by biophysical limits on crop growth. Quantifying food production capacity on every hectare of current farmland in a consistent and transparent manner is needed to inform decisions on policy, research, development and investment that aim to affect future crop yield and land use, and to inform on-ground action by local farmers through their knowledge networks. Crop production capacity can be evaluated by estimating potential yield and water-limited yield levels as benchmarks for crop production under, respectively, irrigated and rainfed conditions. The differences between these theoretical yield levels and actual farmers' yields define the yield gaps, and precise spatially explicit knowledge about these yield gaps is essential to guide sustainable intensification of agriculture. This paper reviews methods to estimate yield gaps, with a focus on the local-to-global relevance of outcomes. Empirical methods estimate yield potential from 90 to 95th percentiles of farmers' yields, maximum yields from experiment stations, growers' yield contests or boundary functions; these are compared with crop simulation of potential or water-limited yields. Comparisons utilize detailed data sets from western Kenya, Nebraska (USA) and Victoria (Australia). We then review global studies, often performed by non-agricultural scientists, aimed at yield and sometimes yield gap assessment and compare several studies in terms of outcomes for regions in Nebraska, Kenya and The Netherlands. Based on our review we recommend key components for a yield gap assessment that can be applied at local to global scales. Given lack of data for some regions, the protocol recommends use of a tiered approach with preferred use of crop growth simulation models applied to relatively homogenous climate zones for which measured weather data are available. Within such zones simulations are performed for the dominant soils and cropping systems considering current spatial distribution of crops. Need for accurate agronomic and current yield data together with calibrated and validated crop models and upscaling methods is emphasized. The bottom-up application of this global protocol allows verification of estimated yield gaps with on-farm data and experiments. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Field experiments and simulation models are useful tools for understanding crop yield gaps, but scaling up these approaches to understand entire regions over time has remained a considerable challenge. Satellite data have repeatedly been shown to provide information that, by themselves or in combination with other data and models, can accurately measure crop yields in farmers' fields. The resulting yield maps provide a unique opportunity to overcome both spatial and temporal scaling challenges and thus improve understanding of crop yield gaps. This review discusses the use of remote sensing to measure the magnitude and causes of yield gaps. Examples from previous work demonstrate the utility of remote sensing, but many areas of possible application remain unexplored. Two simple yet useful approaches are presented that measure the persistence of yield differences between fields, which in combination with maps of average yields can be used to direct further study of specific factors. Whereas the use of remote sensing may have historically been restricted by the cost and availability of fine resolution data, this impediment is rapidly receding.},

@techreport{Sadras2015,
abstract = {The challenges of global agriculture have been analysed exhaustively and the need has been established for sustainable improvement in agricultural production aimed at food security in a context of increasing pressure on natural resources. Whereas the importance of R{\&}D investment in agriculture is increasingly recog- nised, better allocation of limited funding is essential to improve food production. In this context, the common and often large gap between actual and attainable yield is a critical target. Realistic solutions are required to close yield gaps in both small and large scale crop- ping systems worldwide; to make progress in this direction, we need (1) definitions and techniques to measure and model yield at different levels (actual, attainable, potential) and different scales in space (field, farm, region, global) and time (short, long term); (2) identification of the causes of gaps between yield levels; (3) manage- ment options to reduce the gaps where feasible and (4) policies to favour adoption of gap-closing technologies. The aim of this publication is to review the methods for yield gap analysis, and to use case studies to illustrate different approaches, hence addressing the first of these four requirements. Theoretical, potential, water-limited, and actual yield are defined. Yield gap is the difference between two levels of yield in this series. Depending on the objectives of the study, different yield gaps are relevant. The exploitable yield gap accounts for both the unlikely alignment of all factors required for achievement of potential or water limited yield and the economic, management and environmental constraints that preclude, for example, the use of fertiliser rates that maximise yield, when growers' aim is often a compromise between maximising profit and minimising risk at the whole-farm scale, rather than maximising yield of individual crops. The gap between potential and water limited yield is an indication of yield gap that can be removed with irrigation. Spatial and temporal scales for the determination of yield gaps are discussed. Spatially, yield gaps have been quantified at levels of field, region, national or mega-environment and globally. Remote sensing techniques describes the spatial variability of crop yield, even up to individual plots. Time scales can be defined in order to either remove or capture the dynamic components of the environment (soil, climate, biotic components of ecosystems) and technology. Criteria to define scales in both space and time need to be made explicit, and should be consistent with the objectives of the analysis. Satellite measurements can complement in situ measurements. The accuracy of estimating yield gaps is determined by the weakest link, which in many cases is good quality, sub-national scale data on actual yields that farmers achieve. In addition, calculation and interpretation of yield gaps requires reliable weather data, additional agronomic information and transparent assumptions. The main types of methods used in yield benchmarking and gap analysis are outlined using selected case studies. The diversity of benchmarking methods outlined in this xiii ￼publication reflects the diversity of spatial and temporal scales, the questions asked, and the resources available to answer them. We grouped methods in four broad approaches. Approach 1 compares actual yield with the best yield achieved in comparable envi- ronmental conditions, e.g. between neighbours with similar topography and soils. Comparisons of this type are spatially constrained by definition, and are an approxima- tion to the gap between actual and attainable yield. With minimum input and greatest simplicity, this allows for limited but useful benchmarks; yield gaps can be primarily attributed to differences in management. This approach can be biased, however, where best management practices are not feasible; modelled yields provide more relevant benchmarks in these cases. Approach 2 is a variation of approach 1, i.e. it is based on comparisons of actual yield, but instead of a single yield benchmark, yield is expressed as a function of one or few environmental drivers in simple models. In common with Approach 1, these methods do not necessarily capture best management practices. The French and Schultz model is the archetype in this approach; this method plots actual yield against seasonal water use, fits a boundary function representing the best yield for a given water use, and calculates yield gaps as the departure between actual yields and the boundary func- tion. A boundary model fitted to the data provides a scaled benchmark, thus partially accounting for seasonal conditions. Boundary functions can be estimated with different statistical methods but it is recommended that the shape and parameters of boundary functions are also assessed on the basis of their biophysical meaning. Variants of this approach use nitrogen uptake or soil properties instead of water. Approach 3 is based on modelling which may range from simple climatic indices to models of intermediate (e.g. AquaCrop) or high complexity (e.g. CERES-type models). More complex models are valuable agronomically because they capture some genetic features of the specific cultivar, and the critical interaction between water and nitrogen. On the other hand, more complex models have requirements of parameters and inputs that are not always available. “Best practice” approaches to model yield in gap analysis are outlined. Importantly, models to estimate potential yield require parameters that capture the physiology of unstressed crops. Approach 4 benchmarking involves a range of approaches combining actual data, remote sensing, GIS and models of varying complexity. This approach is important for benchmarking at and above the regional scale. At these large scales, particular atten- tion needs to be paid to weather data used in modelling yield because significant bias can accrue from inappropriate data sources. Studies that have used gridded weather databases to simulate potential and water-limited yields for a grid are rarely validated against simulated yields based on actual weather station data from locations within the same grid. This should be standard practice, particularly where global scale yield gaps are used for policy decisions or investment in R{\&}D. Alternatively, point-based simulations of potential and water-limited yields, complemented with an appropriate up-scaling method, may be more appropriate for large scale yield gap analysis. Remote sensing applied to yield gap analysis has improved over the last years, mainly through pixel-based biomass production models. Site-specific yield validation, disaggregated in biomass radiation-use-efficiency and harvest index, remains necessary and need to be carried out every 5 to 10 years.},

abstract = {Given the importance of crop yield and yield progress, this review endeavours to clearly define the different representations of yield, discuss their measurement, and elucidate some controlling factors in yield change. For a field, farm, district or region, average farm or actual yield (FY) is central, but potential (and water-limited potential) yield (PY, PYw) is also an important yardstick. PY is defined here as the measured yield of the best cultivar, grown with optimal agronomy and without manageable biotic and abiotic stresses, under natural resource and cropping system conditions representative of the target area. Economic yield, governed by considerations of profit and risk, and record and theoretical yield, complete the picture. Yield gap is defined as the difference between PY and FY under the same environment. Across most crop-region combinations in the last 2 to 3 decades, FY progress has been associated with both PY progress and yield gap closing, and a simple model, based on linear regression against time, is proposed for understanding this. PY advance is the result of plant breeding and new agronomy (and their interaction, usually positive), while yield gap closing arises with the adoption by farmers of known innovations faster than new ones are invented. Unravelling the true technological component in apparent progress in PY, and especially in FY, is not necessarily simple, and confounding factors are listed and discussed.},

abstract = {Despite the routine collection of annual agricultural surveys and significant advances in GIS and remote sensing products, little econometric research has integrated these data sources in estimating developing nations' agricultural yields. In this paper, we explore the determinants of wheat output per hectare in Ethiopia during the 2011–2013 principal Meher crop seasons at the kebele administrative area. Using a panel data approach, combining national agricultural field surveys with relevant GIS and remote sensing products, the model explains nearly 40{\%} of the total variation in wheat output per hectare across the country. Reflecting on the high interannual variability in output per hectare, we explore whether these changes can be explained by weather, shocks to, and management of rain-fed agricultural systems. The model identifies specific contributors to wheat yields that include farm management techniques (e.g. area planted, improved seed, fertilizer, and irrigation), weather (e.g. rainfall), water availability (e.g. vegetation and moisture deficit indexes) and policy intervention. Our findings suggest that woredas produce between 9.8 and 86.5{\%} of their locally attainable wheat yields given their altitude, weather conditions, terrain, and plant health. In conclusion, we believe the combination of field surveys with spatial data can be used to identify management priorities for improving production at a variety of administrative levels.},

We apply a combination of econometric approaches to a nationally representative, balanced panel of smallholder maize-growing households, and invoke the chain rule to generate quantitative estimates of impacts per kilogram of subsidized seed. Our findings demonstrate that in the initial years of the program, subsidized seed enhanced the well-being of smallholder maize growers according to each indicator, but by small magnitudes.

@article{Cassman1999,
abstract = {Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and maize (Zea mays L.) provide about two-thirds of all energy in human diets, and four major cropping systems in which these cereals are grown represent the foundation of human food supply. Yield per unit time and land has increased markedly during the past 30 years in these systems, a result of intensified crop management involving improved germplasm, greater inputs of fertilizer, production of two or more crops per year on the same piece of land, and irrigation. Meeting future food demand while minimizing expansion of cultivated area primarily will depend on continued intensification of these same four systems. The manner in which further intensification is achieved, however, will differ markedly from the past because the exploitable gap between average farm yields and genetic yield potential is closing. At present, the rate of increase in yield potential is much less than the expected increase in demand. Hence, average farm yields must reach 70-80{\%} of the yield potential ceiling within 30 years in each of these major cereal systems. Achieving consistent production at these high levels without causing environmental damage requires improvements in soil quality and precise management of all production factors in time and space. The scope of the scientific challenge related to these objectives is discussed. It is concluded that major scientific breakthroughs must occur in basic plant physiology, ecophysiology, agroecology, and soil science to achieve the ecological intensification that is needed to meet the expected increase in food demand.},

We find that fertilizer use in Nigeria is not as low as conventional wisdom suggests. Low marginal physical product and high transportation costs significantly reduce the profitability of fertilizer use. Apart from reduced transportation costs, other constraints such as soil quality, timely access to the product, and availability of complementary inputs such as improved seeds, irrigation and credit, as well as good management practices are also necessary for sustained agricultural productivity improvements.},

The analysis draws on data from 85 low- and middle-income countries for the period 2004–2011 to estimate latent class stochastic frontiers in which the technological class to which the country belongs is determined within the model. To enable efficiency comparisons between countries across these technological classes, we estimate a meta-frontier that encompasses all the class frontiers. We embed components of an agricultural innovation systems framework in this estimation to explain countries' technical inefficiency with respect to their respective class frontiers. Mobile phone subscriptions as a measure of institutions that facilitate the transfer of knowledge and information as well as the number of scientific and technical journal articles as a measure of research productivity and knowledge production are found to improve technical efficiency of agricultural production in these countries. The mean technical efficiency score of agricultural production between 2004 and 2011 for countries in class one is 44.1{\%} whereas it is 62.7{\%} for countries in class two, indicating sizeable potential to improve agricultural production from the same level of agricultural inputs through efficiency-enhancing investments.},

Much work needs to be done on models that incorporate uncertainty and interesting dynamics. Exploiting the martingale implications of time additive utility seems fruitful. There is, however, a potentially important distinction between time averages and cross-section averages. A time average of forecast errors over T periods should converge to zero as T→ ∞. But an average of forecast errors across N individuals surely need not converge to zero as N→ ∞; there is a common component in those errors, due to economy-wide innovations. The same point applies when considering covariances of forecast errors with variables that are in the agent's information sets. If those conditioning variables are discrete, one can think of averaging over subsets of the forecast errors; as T→ ∞, these averages should converge to zero but not necessarily as N → ∞.},

abstract = {It is widely perceived that African farmers are under-utilizing inorganic fertilizer. However, very little long-term evidence from farmers' fields, accounting for variations in agro-ecological conditions, has been assembled to back this claim or determine the conditions under which it is true. Using five waves of nationwide household survey data from Kenya covering 13years, we estimate the relative and absolute profitability of nitrogen application rates on maize fields and compare these profitability conditions to observed nitrogen use patterns over time. In general, we find that farmers are consistently and steadily increasing towards risk-adjusted economically optimal rates of fertilizer application over time and that, in the most agriculturally productive areas, farmers' application rates on maize sometimes exceed rates that maximize profitability. Fertilizer use rates may nevertheless be profitably raised in these areas, but doing so will require the adoption of complementary inputs and management practices that raise maize response rates to fertilizer application. This motivates a more holistic approach to input intensification strategies in the region.},

Under complete and competitive markets, households can solve their consumption and production problems separately, so that household factor endowments do not predict input demand. This paper implements a simple, theoretically grounded test of this separation hypothesis, which can be interpreted as a reduced form test of factor market failure. In all five study countries, the analysis finds strong evidence of factor market failure.

abstract = {Common estimates of agricultural productivity rely upon crude measures of crop yield, typically defined as the weight of a crop harvested divided by the area harvested. But this common yield measure poorly reflects performance among farm systems combining multiple crops in one area (e.g., intercropping), and also ignores the possibility that farmers might lose crop area between planting and harvest (e.g., partial crop failure). Drawing on detailed plot-level data from Tanzania's National Panel Survey, this paper contrasts measures of smallholder productivity using production per hectare harvested and production per hectare planted. Yield by area planted differs significantly from yield by area harvested, particularly for smaller farms and female-headed households. OLS regression further reveals different demographic and management-related drivers of variability in yield gains – and thus different implications for policy and development interventions – depending on the yield measurement used. Findings suggest a need to better specify " yield " to more effectively guide agricultural development efforts.},

abstract = {Yield gaps are pervasive in African smallholder agriculture, and are large for almost all crops in all regions. There is consensus that poor soil fertility and nutrient availability are the major biophysical limitations to agricultural production in the continent. We identify two major yield gaps: (1) the gap between actual yields (YA) and the water-limited yield potential (Yw), which is the maximum yield achievable under rainfed conditions without irrigation if soil water capture and storage is optimal and nutrient constraints are released, and (2) The gap between YA, and a locally attainable yield (YL) which corresponds to the water and nutrient-limited yields that can be measured in the most productive fields of resource endowed farmers in a community. Estimates of these two yield gaps are given for major crops, together with a framework for how yield gaps can be estimated in a pragmatic way for different farming systems. The paradigm of ecological intensification which focuses on yield potential, soil quality and precision agriculture is explored for the African context. Our analysis suggests that smallholder farmers are unable to benefit from the current yield gains offered by plant genetic improvement. In particular, continued cropping without sufficient inputs of nutrients and organic matter leads to localised but extensive soil degradation and renders many soils in a non-responsive state. The lack of immediate response to increased inputs of fertiliser and labour in such soils constitutes a chronic poverty trap for many smallholder farmers in Africa. This necessitates a rethink for development policy aimed to improve productivity and address problems of food insecurity. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The argument is that while the yield gap of policy discourse provides a simple and powerful framing device, it is most often used without the discipline or caveats associated with the best examples of its use in crop production ecology and microeconomics. This argument is developed by examining how yield gap is used in a selection of recent and influential agricultural policy documents.

abstract = {Future trajectories of food prices, food security, and cropland expansion are closely linked to future average crop yields in the major agricultural regions of the world. Because the maximum possible yields achieved in farmers' fields might level off or even decline in many regions over the next few decades, reducing the gap between average and potential yields is critical. In most major irrigated wheat, rice, and maize systems, yields appear to be at or near 80{\%} of yield potential, with no evidence for yields having exceeded this threshold to date. A fundamental constraint in these systems appears to be uncertainty in growing season weather; thus tools to address this uncertainty would likely reduce gaps. Otherwise, short-term prospects for yield gains in irrigated agriculture appear grim without increased yield potential. Average yields in rainfed systems are commonly 50{\%} or less of yield potential, suggesting ample room for improvement, though estimation of yield gaps for rainfed regions is subject to ...},

abstract = {Global grain production has increased dramatically during the past 50years, mainly as a consequence of intensified land management and introduction of new technologies. For the future, a strong increase in grain demand is expected, which may be fulfilled by further agricultural intensification rather than expansion of agricultural area. Little is known, however, about the global potential for intensification and its constraints. In the presented study, we analyze to what extent the available spatially explicit global biophysical and land management-related data are able to explain the yield gap of global grain production. We combined an econometric approach with spatial analysis to explore the maximum attainable yield, yield gap, and efficiencies of wheat, maize, and rice production. Results show that the actual grain yield in some regions is already approximating its maximum possible yields while other regions show large yield gaps and therefore tentative larger potential for intensification. Differences in grain production efficiencies are significantly correlated with irrigation, accessibility, market influence, agricultural labor, and slope. Results of regional analysis show, however, that the individual contribution of these factors to explaining production efficiencies strongly varies between world-regions.},

abstract = {Definitions and concepts of production ecology are presented as a basis for development of alternative production technologies characterized by their input-output combinations. With these concepts the relative importance of several growth factors and inputs is investigated to explain actual yield levels and resource-use efficiencies. Differences between potential and actual levels are analyzed to open ways for improved production technologies. The basis of the analysis is knowledge of basic physical, chemical, physiological and ecological processes at soil, field and crop level. New production technologies and their input-output combinations can be used in studies aimed at the exploration of options for sustainable agricultural production systems and land use. The concepts allow a systematic analysis and quantification of input-output combinations and clearly discriminate between bio-physical possibilities and socio-economic constraints and objectives. They help in defining objectives and means for agricultural production and land use, and may be valuable as aids to communication between various disciplines involved in studying the possibility and feasibility of future production technologies and land use options. The concepts production level, physical environment, target-oriented approach, production technique, production activity, and production orientation are applied to identify new technologies and production systems at various levels of scale, each requiring different types of information. In this paper some examples of applications are given at field, farm and at regional level.},

abstract = {This paper asks: What can be done to expand input use in Africa? and Can it be done in a manner that supports continued growth of private sector input markets? The precarious food security situation in many African countries has prompted governments and donors to use input distribution or credit programs as a means of rapidly increasing food supply for the poor. These efforts, however, often reduce the ability of input market development programs to stimulate commercial interest in input supply. A review of both types of programs describes recent efforts to address constraints to expanded input use and finds that further expansion is often constrained by inadequate investment in a variety of public goods needed to stimulate input-led agricultural intensification. Rather than continuing to invest resources in programs to provide inputs or credit directly to farmers, governments (with donor assistance) should consider shifting their focus to the serious deficiencies in the provision of public goods (roads, irrigation, basic education, market information systems, research and extension) and improved institutions (contract law and enforcement, systems of grades and standards). Improvements in these areas can both lower costs of supply and increase farm-level demand, creating a situation where the private sector will have greater incentives to expand input distribution networks to zones and farmers who currently do not have access. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Numerous studies have been published during the past two decades that use simulation models to assess crop yield gaps (quantified as the difference between potential and actual farm yields), impact of climate change on future crop yields, and land-use change. However, there is a wide range in quality and spatial and temporal scale and resolution of climate and soil data underpinning these studies, as well as widely differing assumptions about cropping-system context and crop model calibration. Here we present an explicit rationale and methodology for selecting data sources for simulating crop yields and estimating yield gaps at specific locations that can be applied across widely different levels of data availability and quality. The method consists of a tiered approach that identifies the most scientifically robust requirements for data availability and quality, as well as other, less rigorous options when data are not available or are of poor quality. Examples are given using this approach to estimate maize yield gaps in the state of Nebraska (USA), and at a national scale for Argentina and Kenya. These examples were selected to represent contrasting scenarios of data availability and quality for the variables used to estimate yield gaps. The goal of the proposed methods is to provide transparent, reproducible, and scientifically robust guidelines for estimating yield gaps; guidelines which are also relevant for simulating the impact of climate change and land-use change at local to global spatial scales. Likewise, the improved understanding of data requirements and alternatives for simulating crop yields and estimating yield gaps as described here can help identify the most critical “data gaps” and focus global efforts to fill them. A related paper (Van Bussel et al., 2015) examines issues of site selection to minimize data requirements and up-scaling from location-specific estimates to regional and national spatial scales.},

Yet, this belief is predicated on the assumption that it is profitable to use rates higher than currently observed. However, there is little rigorous empirical evidence to support this notion. Using a nationally representative panel data set, and with due recognition of the role of risk and uncertainty, this paper empirically estimates the profitability of fertilizer use for maize production in Nigeria. The analysis finds that inorganic fertilizer use in Nigeria is not as low as conventional wisdom suggests. Low marginal physical product and high transportation costs significantly reduce the profitability of fertilizer use. The paper finds evidence that strategies to reduce transportation costs are likely to have a much larger effect on the profitability of fertilizer use than fertilizer subsidies. Apart from reduced transportation costs, other constraints such as timely access to the product; availability of complementary inputs such as improved seeds, irrigation, and credit; as well as good management practices are also necessary for sustained agricultural productivity improvements.},

abstract = {Stochastic frontier models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood (MLE) or corrected ordinary least squares. The consistency of either estimator depends on exogeneity of the explanatory variables (inputs, in the production frontier setting). We will investigate the case that one or more of the inputs is endogenous, in the simultaneous equation sense of endogeneity. That is, we worry that there is correlation between the inputs and statistical noise or inefficiency. In a standard regression setting, simultaneity is handled by a number of procedures that are numerically or asymptotically equivalent. These include 2SLS; using the residual from the reduced form equations for the endogenous variables as a control function; and MLE of the system that contains the equation of interest plus the unrestricted reduced form equations for the endogenous variables (LIML). We will consider modifications of these standard procedures for the stochastic frontier setting. The paper is mostly a survey and combination of existing results from the stochastic frontier literature and the classic simultaneous equations literature, but it also contains some new results.},

abstract = {A central question in development eco- nomics is, how can we account for differ- ences in the levels of income and the rates of growth between the developed and less de- veloped economies? In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a standard answer to this ques- tion: the poor are just like the rich, except they are poorer-they have less human and nonhuman capital. There was an immediate prescription for this diagnosis: increase the resources of LDCs, either by transferring capital to them (either direct aid or educa- tion) or by encouraging them to save more...},
